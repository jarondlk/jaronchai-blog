I made an e-commerce based on human computer interaction principles, the e-commerce site is called "Le Fishe Plushies" Which you can view it [here](https://jarondlk.github.io/le-fishe-plushies/)

Welcome to Le Fishe Plushies, an e-commerce site that's all about making your shopping experience as easy and enjoyable as possible. 

As a developer and a shopper myself, I know how frustrating it can be to navigate a confusing website or struggle to find what you're looking for. That's why we've made sure that our site is built with the principles of human computer interaction in mind, so you can shop with ease.

One of the things we've done is to keep the layout and navigation consistent throughout the site. This way, you can find what you're looking for without getting lost in a maze of pages. And don't worry about what device you're using, our site is fully compatible with desktops, laptops, tablets and mobile phones.

We also want you to know what's going on with your order at all times, so we've added visual cues and notifications to keep you informed. For example, you'll see the shopping cart icon updating in real-time, and a notification when a product has been added to your cart.

And last but not least, we want your shopping experience to be as simple and efficient as possible. That's why we've designed our site to be minimalistic and easy to navigate, with clear call-to-action buttons and a search bar that makes finding what you're looking for a breeze.

At Le Fishe Plushies, we believe that by incorporating HCI principles, we've created an e-commerce experience that's not only user-friendly but also enjoyable for our customers. We are constantly looking for ways to improve our site and welcome any feedback from our customers.

Thank you for choosing Le Fishe Plushies, and happy shopping!

Life sometimes can get hectic with classes, assignments, exams, extracurricular activities, and social life all vying for your attention. Keeping track of it all can be a real challenge, but Notion's calendar view can help make your life easier and more productive.

Notion is a powerful productivity and organization tool that offers a range of features, including a calendar view that can help you manage your schedule, set reminders, and plan out your days and weeks. Whether you're a student, a working professional, or a busy parent, Notion's calendar view can help you stay on top of your schedule and achieve your goals.

One of the key benefits of Notion's calendar view is that it provides a visual representation of your schedule. This makes it easier to see at a glance what you need to do, when you need to do it, and how you're progressing with your tasks. With Notion, you can create tasks and events in your calendar, set reminders, and categorize your tasks based on their priority.

Another benefit of Notion's calendar view is that it integrates with other features of the platform. For example, you can link your tasks to your notes and databases, so you have all the information you need in one place. This makes it easier to keep track of your schedule and stay organized, without having to switch between multiple apps or platforms.

As an undergrad student, you're likely juggling a variety of responsibilities, from attending classes and studying, to participating in extracurricular activities and working on projects. Notion's calendar view can help you manage all of these tasks in one place, so you can focus on what's most important. You can also set recurring tasks, so you never forget to complete important tasks like studying for exams or attending club meetings.

### Here's a few steps to set you up for the Calendar view

Step 1: Create a New Page

To get started with Notion's calendar view, you'll need to create a new page. To do this, click on the "New Page" button in the top-right corner of the Notion window. Give your new page a title, such as "My Schedule," and select the "Calendar" template. This will give you a basic calendar view that you can customize to fit your needs.

Step 2: Add Tasks and Events

Once you've created your new calendar page, you can start adding tasks and events. To add a task, simply click on a date in the calendar view, and then click on the "Add Task" button. Give your task a title, set a due date, and add any additional details or notes as needed.

To add an event, click on the "Add Event" button and follow the same steps. You can also set a start time and end time for your event, so you can keep track of your schedule in more detail.

Step 3: Set Reminders

Notion's calendar view also allows you to set reminders for your tasks and events. This is a great way to ensure that you never forget a deadline or appointment. To set a reminder, simply click on a task or event in the calendar view, and then click on the "Remind Me" button. You can set a reminder for a specific date and time, or choose to be reminded a certain amount of time before the task or event is due.

Step 4: Organize Your Tasks and Events

Notion's calendar view allows you to categorize and organize your tasks and events in a variety of ways. You can create custom categories, such as "Classes," "Assignments," and "Exams," and then assign each task or event to a category. This makes it easier to see at a glance what you need to do and when you need to do it.

You can also set priority levels for your tasks and events, so you can focus on what's most important. For example, you might want to set a high priority for an exam that's coming up, or a low priority for a task that can be done later.

Step 5: View Your Schedule

Finally, once you've added your tasks and events and set reminders, you can use Notion's calendar view to see your schedule at a glance. You can view your schedule by day, week, or month, and even change the start and end times for each day. This makes it easy to see how your schedule is shaping up, and make any necessary adjustments.

Notion's calendar view can streamline your life as an undergrad student by making it easier to manage your schedule, set reminders, and stay organized. Whether you're looking to stay on top of your class schedule, manage your time more effectively, or just simplify your life, Notion's calendar view can help you achieve your goals and lead a more productive life.

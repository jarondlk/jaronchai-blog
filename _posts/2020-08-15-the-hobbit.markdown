## The Hobbit: The

Author: J.R.R. Tolkien
Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

### Behind the Book

Hey everyone! In this post, I want to dive into the history of one of the most epic stories of all time: "The Hobbit". You might already know the story of Bilbo Baggins and his journey to the Lonely Mountain, but did you know the story behind the story? Let's take a trip down memory lane and see how this classic came to be.

First off, "The Hobbit" was written by J.R.R. Tolkien, a professor at Oxford University and a total language and mythology nerd. He had this entire world of Middle-earth already brewing in his head, and he needed an outlet to share it with others. That's where "The Hobbit" comes in. He originally wrote it as a bedtime story for his kids and they loved it! So, he kept on writing and eventually published the book in 1937.

At first, "The Hobbit" was just a simple children's story, but it was so well received that Tolkien was inspired to continue the tale. He began working on what would become the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, and the two stories ended up fitting together perfectly. The rest, as they say, is history. "The Hobbit" and "The Lord of the Rings" have become two of the most beloved and iconic works of fantasy fiction of all time.

So, what's the takeaway from all of this? Well, first of all, never underestimate the power of a good bedtime story. Secondly, it just goes to show you that sometimes the most amazing things can come from the simplest of beginnings. And lastly, who knew that a professor at Oxford could be such a boss at storytelling?

### An Analysis on the Unexpected Journey

At its core, "The Hobbit" is a tale of personal growth and self-discovery. Bilbo Baggins starts off as a content, but somewhat complacent hobbit, living a comfortable life in the Shire. However, as he embarks on his journey with the dwarves, he is forced out of his comfort zone and into a world filled with danger and adventure. Through his experiences, Bilbo transforms from a timid hobbit into a confident and brave hero, who is able to stand up for what is right and defend those he loves.

This theme of personal growth is highlighted by the motif of the ring. Throughout the story, the ring is both a source of power and a symbol of temptation. Bilbo uses the ring to escape danger, but it also puts him in harm's way and puts those he loves at risk. The ring represents the struggle between good and evil, and Bilbo must ultimately choose to do the right thing and give up the ring.

Another key aspect of "The Hobbit" is the idea of home and belonging. As Bilbo travels through Middle-earth, he longs for the comfort and safety of his home in the Shire. However, as he grows and changes throughout his journey, he begins to understand that home is not just a physical place, but a sense of belonging and purpose. This theme is reflected in the character of Smaug, who has taken over the dwarves' home and treasure, symbolizing the danger of greed and the importance of preserving what is important and valuable.

Finally, "The Hobbit" also explores the theme of courage and bravery. Bilbo's journey is filled with obstacles and challenges, and he must use his courage and bravery to overcome them. Through his experiences, Bilbo learns that being brave doesn't mean being fearless, but rather having the courage to face fear and do what is right, even when it is difficult.

All in all, "The Hobbit" is a rich and complex work that has much to offer beyond its surface level story. With its themes of personal growth, home and belonging, and courage and bravery, it is a timeless tale that has something to say to readers of all ages.

The story follows hobbit Bilbo Baggins on an epic adventure through Middle-earth with a group of dwarves, accompanied by the wizard Gandalf.

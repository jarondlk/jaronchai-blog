A double-sideband suppressed-carrier communication system design project. The design in this project are presented in three major parts, which are modulation, distortion and demodulation of the signal. The project can also be 

Double-Sideband Suppressed-Carrier Communication System Implementation in Matlab.
The DSB-SC system composed of:

1. Modulation of a signal, which modulates the amplitude of the incoming signal
2. Distortion of a signal when it passes through a communication channel
3. Demodulation of a signal, which utilize the low-pass-filter. In which the final signal will form a scaled and distorted version of the original message signal.

## Introduction to DSB-SC and design overview

### Double-sideband suppressed-carrier (DSB-SC) transmission

Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier transmission is the transmission of a modulated wave, which only sidebands are transmitted through the communication system, while the carrier wave is being suppressed.

In example above, the frequency of message and carrier wave is 100Hz and 500Hz respectively and the amplitude of both is 1.

### DSB-SC communication system design problem statement

#### Design a DSB-SC communication system following the diagram below

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/dsbsc/2.png)

Given channel characteristic $$ H(f)=e^{-2j\pi30t}+e^{-2j\pi5t} $$

#### Baseband signal for my DSB-SC system

Baseband message signal m(t)  is composed with three frequencies, based on my last 3 digits of my student ID, which is 2021610064 (old)

$$ m(t)=cos(2\pi100t)-\frac13cos(2\pi60t)+\frac15cos(2\pi4t) $$

### Overview of the system design

Introduction to the approach to the design of each part of the system, which each steps will be expand further in the next respective sections.

#### Message signal modulation

Generation of modulated message signal, m(t), with the carrier signal, resulting in a DSB-SC modulated waveform.

$$ x(t)=m(t)\times c(t) $$

Where x(t) is the output modulated signal, m(t) is the message signal, and the multiplying term, c(t) , is the carrier signal.

#### Channel distortion

Once the modulated signal pass through the Linear Time-Invariant communication channel, distortion will have effect on the passing signal, by the channel characteristic.

#### Demodulation of signal

Demodulated signal is the product of y(t) and the carrier signal.

$$ v(t)=y(t)\times c(t) $$

Where v(t) is the demodulated signal, y(t) is the modulated signal after being distorted through the communication channel.

#### Entering Low-Pass-Filter

Passes original message signals, with a frequency lower than the cutoff frequency and reduce the amplitude of carrier signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency.

#### Resulting output signal

The resulting signal after the demodulation and the application of the Low pass filter, will be a scaled and distorted version of the message signal.

#### Note on graphical plots

The range of the time that use to scale the figures in time domain is from -0.1 to 0.1, with incrementation of  $$ 1/f_s $$, where $$ f_s $$ is the sampling frequency.

## Modulated Signal Analysis

### Baseband signal observation

Baseband signals are signals that occupied the range of frequencies, which has not been through the process of modulation.

#### Message and Carrier signals

The message signal and the carrier signal, $$c(t)=A_ccos(2\pi f_ct)$$ with carrier signal amplitude of 1 and frequency of 1kHz is plotted and shown below.

#### Fourier transform of Message signal

We can observe the frequency range of the message signal clearer in the frequency domain. As shown in figure 2.1.2, the frequencies are around at 4Hz, 60Hz and 100Hz, which represent the frequencies of the message.

### Modulation of the Message signal

From modulated wave equation, we can get the modulated signal from the product of the message signal and the carrier signal. The plot of the signal after DSB-SC modulation is shown in figure below.

From the modulated signal, $$x(t)=m(t)\times c(t)$$

$$x(t)= (cos(2\pi100t)-\frac13cos(2\pi60t)+\frac15cos(2\pi4t))\times (cos(2\pi 1000t))$$

### Fourier transform of modulated signal

If we take the Fourier transform of the modulated signal, it is apparent that the carrier signal component is being suppressed, as it isnâ€™t visible in the output signal in frequency domain.

When the spectrum of the output signal is viewed. In figure above we see six peaks, the three peaks below 1kHz are the lower sideband and the three peaks above 1kHz are the upper sideband, but there is no peak at the 1kHz point, which denotes the frequency of the carrier, which has been suppressed.

## Distortions in communication channel

### Channel distortion in frequency domain

To get the signal y(t), with given channel characteristic H(f), we can convert x(t) to X(f), and use the converted signal to find Y(f) in frequency domain. Which lastly the signal can be convert back to time domain as y(t).

#### Convert x(t) to X(f) in frequency domain

We can take the Fourier transform of the signal x(t) to get X(f).

$$ X(f)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t)\ e^{-2\pi j t} \,dt $$

$$
X(f)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} (cos(2\pi100t)-\frac13cos(2\pi60t)+\frac15cos(2\pi4t))\times (cos(2\pi 1000t)) \cdot e^{-2\pi j t} \,dt
$$

$$
\begin{align}
{X(f)=}
{\frac{1}{2} [\pi\delta(f-1800\pi)+\delta(f+1800\pi)]} - \\
{\frac{1}{6} [(\pi\delta(f-1880\pi)+\delta(f+1880\pi)]} + \\
{\frac{1}{10} [(\pi\delta(f-1992\pi)+\delta(f+1992\pi)]} + \\
{\frac{1}{10} [(\pi\delta(f-2008\pi)+\delta(f+2008\pi)]} - \\
{\frac{1}{6} [(\pi\delta(f-2120\pi)+\delta(f+2120\pi)]} + \\
{\frac{1}{2} [(\pi\delta(f-2200\pi)+\delta(f+2200\pi)]}
\end{align}
$$

#### Apply Channel Distortion

Now that both of the channels characteristic and the modulated signal are in the frequency domain, the input-output relationship in frequency domain is given by $$ Y(f) = H(f)X(f) $$.

$$
\begin{align}

{Y(f)=}
{X(f) H(f)}

\end{align}
$$

$$
\begin{align}
{Y(f)=}
\pi(\delta(f-1800\pi)+\delta(f+1800\pi))(1+1.1392e^{-14j})- \\
\pi(\delta(f-1880\pi)+\delta(f+1880\pi))(\frac{1}{3}+3.7972e^{-15j})+ \\
\pi(\delta(f-1992\pi)+\delta(f+1992\pi))(\frac{1}{5}+2.2783e^{-15j})+ \\
\pi(\delta(f-2008\pi)+\delta(f+2008\pi))(\frac{1}{5}+2.2783e^{-15j})- \\
\pi(\delta(f-2120\pi)+\delta(f+2120\pi))(\frac{1}{3}+3.7972e^{-15j})+ \\
\pi(\delta(f-2200\pi)+\delta(f+2200\pi))(1+1.1392e^{-14j})

\end{align}
$$

By multiply H(f), which is given by the channel characteristic equation and shown in figure 3.1.2 i. with X(f), the resulting signal will be Y(f) in the frequency domain

### Conversion to Time Domain

#### Convert Y(f) bcak to y(t)

We can take the inverse Fourier transform to the signal Y(f) to get y(t), which is in the time domain again.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/image/dsbsc/10.png)

$$
\begin{align}
{y(t)=}
\frac{1}{2\pi}\big[
\pi(e^{-\pi t 1800 j}+e^{\pi t 1800 j})(1+1.1392e^{-14j})- \\
\pi(e^{-\pi t 1880 j}+e^{\pi t 1880 j})(\frac{1}{3}+3.7972e^{-15j})+ \\
\pi(e^{-\pi t 1992 j}+e^{\pi t 1992 j})(\frac{1}{5}+2.2783e^{-15j})+ \\
\pi(e^{-\pi t 2008 j}+e^{\pi t 2008 j})(\frac{1}{5}+2.2783e^{-15j})- \\
\pi(e^{-\pi t 2120 j}+e^{\pi t 2120 j})(\frac{1}{3}+3.7972e^{-15j})+ \\
\pi(e^{-\pi t 2200 j}+e^{\pi t 2200 j})(1+1.1392e^{-14j})
\big]

\end{align}
$$

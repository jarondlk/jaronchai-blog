Double-Sideband Suppressed-Carrier Communication System Implementation in Matlab.
The DSB-SC system composed of:

1. Modulation of a signal, which modulates the amplitude of the incoming signal
2. Distortion of a signal when it passes through a communication channel
3. Demodulation of a signal, which utilize the low-pass-filter. In which the final signal will form a scaled and distorted version of the original message signal.

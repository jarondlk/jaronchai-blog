Welcome to my technology and shenanigans blog! My name is Jaronchai and I am a Junior AI Developer at the Data Science Laboratory of TNIC. As a student studying engineering in Bangkok, Thailand, I have a passion for all things technology and am excited to share my knowledge and experiences with you.

In this blog, I will be discussing a variety of topics related to technology, including the latest developments in artificial intelligence, computer science, and data science. I will also share my personal experiences as a student and developer, providing insights and tips for those who are also interested in pursuing a career in technology.

I believe that technology is constantly evolving and it is important to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and advancements. My goal is to provide valuable information and resources to those who are interested in learning more about the field of technology, and to contribute to the ongoing conversation about the future of technology.

Thank you for joining me on this journey, and I look forward to sharing my knowledge and experiences with you.

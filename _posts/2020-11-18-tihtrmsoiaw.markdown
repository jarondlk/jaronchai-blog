This is a page that I will update periodically, as I discover more and more life “lessons" and stuff that I feel worth sharing. I will divide the list into 3 major categories: Life in general, Wellbeing, and Growth.

Disclaimer: I am by no mean forcing you, the reader, to do any of this. I made this page to remind *myself*, and I just feel like they are worth sharing. But if you find any points in the list that relates to you and you could apply it for the betterment of your life, that’s amazing!! :3

## Life in General

+ Be honest / Genuine in confrontations, and in general
+ It doesn’t hurt to reach out
+ No need to be best, only good and kind
+ It’s either a “Hell Yeah!” or a “no”
+ Go first! POV: Everyone is friendly, I just need to go first
+ When you're confused go back to basics
+ Choose the simplest tool possible

## Wellbeing

+ Go for a walk, clear your head
+ Write down stressful thoughts, get a bigger picture
+ Optimism isn’t “everything will work out”, but “everything can work out”

## Growth

+ **FAKE IT ’TIL YOU MAKE IT** (this, so much this)
+ Ask yourself “How badly do I want it?”
+ Do not become small for people who refuse to grow
+ Perfection is an enemy of good. Just do it and MOVE ON.
+ Nothing in life is complicated, everything id figure-out-able
+ When it feels scary to jump, that’s exactly when you should jump in

So you’ve read all the way here! I hope this page could help you in one way or another like it does helps me!! :>

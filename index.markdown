## Hi there! I'm **Jaronchai**

I am a Junior AI Researcher at the Data Science Laboratory of [TNIC](https://tnic.tni.ac.th). I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Digital Engineering at TNIC.

I'm also a Campus Leader for Notion@TNIC and notion certified. Check out [here](https://alfyn.notion.site/Notion-TNIC-3fc48506de00458788d9f1bcbcf13bc7) in case there is a Notion event that I host coming up that might interest you!

My interests include Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science and Data Science. As an experienced Computer Laboratory Assistant, I have a strong background in the field of technology, and I am excited to share my knowledge, experiences AND shenanigans with you

## Hi there! I am **Jaronchai**

I am a Junior AI Researcher at the Data Science and Analytics Laboratory of TNIC. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering in Digital Engineering at the TNIC. 

My interests include Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science and Data Science. As an experienced Computer Laboratory Assistant, I have a strong background in the field of technology, and I am excited to share my knowledge, experiences AND shenanigans with you ;3

I do stuff with computer and sometimes I write them [here][blog]. I write about other things too, my experience in the university and all!

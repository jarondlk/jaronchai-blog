Welcome to my blog about technology and shenanigans! As an undergraduate student studying technology, I have a passion for all things related to gadgets, software, and the latest advancements in the tech industry. But, let's be real, not everything in life is all work and no play. That's why I also like to write about my experiences and thoughts on the lighter side of life, the shenanigans.

In this blog, you'll find a mix of informative articles on the latest technology trends, reviews of the latest gadgets and software, as well as personal anecdotes and musings on my experiences as a student and young adult.

But I'm not all about technology all the time, I also like to share my thoughts on the lighter side of life. From my latest travel experiences to my thoughts on the latest movie or TV show, there will be something for everyone to enjoy.

So, whether you're a tech enthusiast or just someone looking for a good read, I hope you'll find something here that interests you. Thanks for stopping by and I hope you'll come back for more technology and shenanigans!

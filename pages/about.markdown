Welcome to my blog about technology and shenanigans! As an undergraduate student studying technology, I have a passion for all things related to gadgets, software, and the latest advancements in the tech industry. But, let's be real, not everything in life is all work and no play. That's why I also like to write about my experiences and thoughts on the lighter side of life, the shenanigans.

## What is this blog about?

In this blog, you'll find a mix of informative articles on the latest technology trends, reviews of the latest gadgets and software, as well as personal anecdotes and musings on my experiences as a student and young adult. In addition, I'll also be reviwing books that I enjoyed or movies and music that I particularly like as well!

I hope you'll find something here that interests you. Thanks for stopping by and I hope you'll come back for more technology and shenanigans!

Welcome to my 'Uses' page, where I share the tools, hardware, and software that I use on a daily basis to support my work and productivity. From my favorite text editor to the computer I work on, this page provides a glimpse into my workflow and setup. 

This isn't the first time that I've written a 'Uses' article, however this is the first time that I'm publishing it on my site.

I hope this page not only gives you a better understanding of my technical setup, but also inspires you to try out new tools and techniques. Let's dive in!

The softwares the I use concurrently with these devices will be discuss in the follwing sections.

### Stationaries

The stationery items that are essential to my creative process, organization, and daily note-taking. These tools are integral to keeping my thoughts organized and turning ideas into actionable tasks. Let's explore:

#### Muji Customizable Journal

I swear by the Muji Customizable Journal as my go-to notebook for all my note-taking needs. Its minimalistic design and high-quality paper provide the perfect canvas for jotting down ideas, sketches, and to-do lists. The ability to **customize the journal's layout** to my preferences makes it a versatile companion for both work and personal projects.

#### Gel Pens

For everyday writing, I rely on gel pens. Muji Gel pen line are my preferred gel pen brands. The smooth ink flow and vibrant colors make writing a pleasure, and they are perfect for taking quick notes, jotting down ideas, or working on creative projects.

##### Fountain Pens

I find fountain pens to be a delight to use, offering a smooth and elegant writing experience. Among my collection, I particularly enjoy using Lamy and Waterman fountain pens. Lamy's ergonomic design and interchangeable nibs allow for different writing styles, while Waterman pens exude a timeless charm. These fountain pens are perfect for journaling, personal reflections, or any writing that deserves a touch of sophistication.

## Software

### Global Services and Apps

In this section, I'll introduce you to the software applications and services I use across various platforms. These tools play a crucial role in organizing my work, staying productive, and keeping me entertained. Let's explore each one:

#### Notion

Notion is the backbone of my productivity and organization. It serves as an all-in-one workspace, combining note-taking, task management, project planning, and more. With its flexible structure and powerful features, I use Notion to create detailed to-do lists, maintain databases, and store valuable information. The ability to customize layouts and templates makes it a versatile tool that adapts to my ever-changing needs.

#### Things

Things is my go-to task manager on macOS and iOS. Its elegant and intuitive design allows me to organize and prioritize my tasks effortlessly. I rely on Things to create daily to-do lists, set reminders, and track my progress on various projects. Its seamless integration with Apple's ecosystem ensures that I stay on top of my tasks, whether I'm at my desk or on the go.

#### Apple Calendar

Apple Calendar is my primary tool for scheduling and time management. I use it to keep track of meetings, appointments, deadlines, and personal events. Its user-friendly interface and cross-device synchronization make it easy to stay organized and never miss an important event.

#### Spotify

For entertainment and background music while working, Spotify is my preferred music streaming service. Its extensive library of songs and curated playlists cater to my diverse musical tastes, helping me stay focused and motivated during long working hours.

#### Apple Books

As an avid reader, I turn to Apple Books for my digital reading needs. Whether it's fiction, non-fiction, or educational material, Apple Books provides a vast selection of e-books that I can access on my iPad or iPhone.

#### Others

* [Reeder](https://reederapp.com): Personal favorite RSS reader
* [Canva](https://www.canva.com): General presentation making, interchangable with Keynote

#### Note on Dark/Light Theme

I prefer the **light theme** over the dark theme in my software applications. The bright interface helps me maintain focus and clarity while working. Additionally, I appreciate the Solarized theme, which strikes a balance between light and dark, providing a soothing color scheme that is easy on the eyes.

### MacOS

In this section, I'll introduce you to the macOS-specific software applications I use to streamline my development, simplify the Mac menubar, and enhance my productivity. Let's explore each application:

#### Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is my preferred code editor for macOS. Its lightweight yet powerful features make it perfect for coding in various programming languages. With a vast array of extensions available, I customize VS Code to suit my specific needs, boosting my coding efficiency and providing a seamless development experience.

#### Xcode

Xcode is an essential macOS application for iOS and macOS developers. As an integrated development environment (IDE), it allows me to create, debug, and test apps for Apple devices. Xcode's comprehensive set of tools, including the Interface Builder and SwiftUI, enables me to build cutting-edge applications for the Apple ecosystem.

#### Dozer and Stats

Dozer and Stats are two Swift-based applications that enhance my Mac menubar experience and provide valuable real-time system status information.

[Dozer](https://github.com/Mortennn/Dozer): Dozer allows me to simplify the menubar by hiding or rearranging status icons, reducing visual clutter and providing a cleaner desktop environment.\
[Stats](https://github.com/exelban/stats): Stats delivers at-a-glance real-time information on my Mac's CPU, GPU, storage, and network status. This helps me monitor system performance and ensure optimal efficiency during resource-intensive tasks.

## Potential Upgrades in the Future

So far this paged described the setup that I'm currently using. The following are tools or hardware, I would like to learn to use in the future.

* Apple Watch (upgrade from Xiaomi Smart Band 7)

## What I stopped using

* Goodnotes (to Notability): I feel like the tools bar is taking up too much workspace area and once you have quite a large library of notes, the application feels sluggish.
* Google Chrome (to Safari): I stopped using Google Chrome since I started using Apple's Safari for about two months. Chrome feels too clunky for using on Apple's device, and Safari is by far a way more secure browser.
* Pycharm (to VScode): Since later VScode updates, nearly all of the features that I normally use on pycharm, is available on VScode.

Welcome to my 'Uses' page, where I share the tools, hardware, and software that I use on a daily basis to support my work and productivity. From my favorite text editor to the computer I work on, this page provides a glimpse into my workflow and setup. I hope this page not only gives you a better understanding of my technical setup, but also inspires you to try out new tools and techniques. Let's dive in!

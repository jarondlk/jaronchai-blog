Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is my preferred code editor for macOS. Its lightweight yet powerful features make it perfect for coding in various programming languages. With a vast array of extensions available, I customize VS Code to suit my specific needs, boosting my coding efficiency and providing a seamless development experience.

#### Xcode

Xcode is an essential macOS application for iOS and macOS developers. As an integrated development environment (IDE), it allows me to create, debug, and test apps for Apple devices. Xcode's comprehensive set of tools, including the Interface Builder and SwiftUI, enables me to build cutting-edge applications for the Apple ecosystem.

#### Dozer and Stats

Dozer and Stats are two Swift-based applications that enhance my Mac menubar experience and provide valuable real-time system status information.

With its vast collection of audiobooks, I can now indulge in captivating stories, informative non-fiction, and thrilling mysteries, even during my busiest days. Whether I'm commuting, exercising, or simply unwinding, Audible accompanies me with fantastic narrations, making every moment an opportunity to explore new worlds and gain knowledge.

## Potential Upgrades in the Future

While I'm currently content with my setup, I'm always eager to explore new tools and hardware that could further enhance my productivity and overall experience. Here are some exciting potential upgrades that I'm considering for the future:

* Apple Watch (upgrade from Xiaomi Smart Band 7): As my interest in fitness and health tracking grows, I'm intrigued by the possibilities offered by the Apple Watch. With its advanced features, including heart rate monitoring, ECG, and a range of fitness apps, it promises to be a significant upgrade from my current Xiaomi Smart Band 7. The seamless integration with other Apple devices is also appealing, making it a potential addition to my Apple ecosystem.

## What I stopped using

* Goodnotes (to Notability): As much as I enjoyed using Goodnotes for note-taking, I eventually switched to Notability due to its more intuitive interface and seamless iCloud integration. With Notability, I found that the tools bar takes up less workspace area, allowing me to focus more on my notes and sketches. Additionally, as my note library grew, Goodnotes began to feel sluggish, while Notability continues to provide a smooth and responsive experience.
* Google Chrome (to Safari): For a long time, I relied on Google Chrome as my go-to browser. However, after giving Apple's Safari a try, I was pleasantly surprised by its speed, efficiency, and integration with macOS and iOS devices. Safari's focus on privacy and security also resonated with me, making it my preferred browser for the past couple of months. Its seamless synchronization with my Apple devices ensures a consistent and secure browsing experience.
* Pycharm (to VScode): As a developer, Pycharm was my IDE of choice for Python programming. However, with the latest updates to Visual Studio Code (VScode), I've found that nearly all the features I normally use in Pycharm are now available in VScode. Its lightweight yet powerful nature and extensive library of extensions have made it a compelling alternative. I'm considering making the switch to VScode in the future to streamline my development workflow across different languages and projects.

Welcome to my 'Uses' page, where I share the tools, hardware, and software that I use on a daily basis to support my work and productivity. From my favorite text editor to the computer I work on, this page provides a glimpse into my workflow and setup. 

This isn't the first time that I've written a 'Uses' article, however this is the first time that I'm publishing it on my site.

I hope this page not only gives you a better understanding of my technical setup, but also inspires you to try out new tools and techniques. Let's dive in!

If you're interested in similar lists, I recommend that you visit the [wesbos/awesome-uses](https://github.com/wesbos/awesome-uses) repository on GitHub.

## Potential Upgrades in the Future

So far this paged described the setup that I'm currently using. The following are tools or hardware, I would like to learn to use in the future.

* Apple Watch (upgrade from Xiaomi Smart Band 7)

## What I stopped using

* Goodnotes (to Notability): I feel like the tools bar is taking up too much workspace area and once you have quite a large library of notes, the application feels sluggish.
* Google Chrome (to Safari): I stopped using Google Chrome since I started using Apple's Safari for about two months. Chrome feels too clunky for using on Apple's device, and Safari is by far a way more secure browser.
* Pycharm (to VScode): Since later VScode updates, nearly all of the features that I normally use on pycharm, is available on VScode.
